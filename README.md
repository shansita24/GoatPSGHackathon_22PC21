# Fleet Management System with Traffic Negotiation for Multi-Robots

## Approach

This project implements a **graph-based fleet management system** for multiple autonomous robots, ensuring smooth navigation and efficient traffic handling. The core of this system is built around **real-time pathfinding, lane reservation, and a dynamic GUI**, enabling intuitive interaction and monitoring of robot movements.

### Key Aspects of the Approach:

1. **Graph-Based Navigation**
   - The environment is represented as a **graph** where:
     - Nodes (vertices) represent locations.
     - Edges (lanes) define paths between locations.
   - This allows for efficient path planning and decision-making.

2. **Real-Time Traffic Management**
   - A **traffic manager** ensures safe movement by preventing multiple robots from occupying the same lane.
   - Robots request lane access before moving, reducing congestion and avoiding deadlocks.

3. **Multi-Robot Coordination**
   - Each robot follows an assigned **path** with dynamic obstacle avoidance.
   - Robots **wait if a lane is occupied**, ensuring smooth coordination without collisions.

4. **Scalable and Interactive GUI**
   - The GUI provides a **visual representation** of robot movement, lane occupancy, and navigation.
   - Users can **select, assign tasks, and monitor** robots in real-time.
   - Features include **zoom, pan, and interactive clicks** to enhance usability.

## Strengths of This Approach

### âœ… **Efficient Pathfinding and Navigation**
- The **graph-based structure** enables efficient path search, ensuring that robots take the shortest available routes.
- **Real-time traffic control** prevents collisions and optimizes robot flow.

### âœ… **Scalable Multi-Robot System**
- The approach is **scalable**, allowing multiple robots to operate simultaneously.
- Supports **dynamic robot spawning** at any node without disrupting the system.

### âœ… **Effective Traffic Negotiation**
- **Lane reservation logic** ensures only one robot moves through a path segment at a time.
- Prevents **traffic deadlocks** and congestion.

### âœ… **User-Friendly and Intuitive Interface**
- **Interactive GUI** provides real-time visualization of the fleetâ€™s status.
- Users can **assign tasks, track movement, and monitor robot states** with ease.

### âœ… **Thread-Based Real-Time Execution**
- Uses **multi-threading** for parallel execution of robot movements.
- Robots update their position smoothly, improving simulation realism.

  This image shows the gui where we can view the graph with the corresponding vertices and edges which can be changed in the nav_graph.json file.

  After selection of the vertex B when we click on vertex A the robot moves from B to A in the shortest route possible.

  This image shows the Robot 1 charging on the vertex G again this charging vertices also can be changed in the nav_graph.json file.Now we can spawn a new Robot 2 again in the vertex B, now this robot 2 would not be able to pass through or be able to be placed on the vertex in which robot 1 is present.
